# simple microserver written in flusk thats return hello-world 

# this is full ci/cd it will be triggered on push 

# starting as installing requirments then buidling dockerfile with checkg docker vulernability then push it to dockerhub 
# i am using ssm to ssh to ec2 instance to install docker and minikube and then applying the kubernetes deployment file and service 

# what can be enanched in this project is i could use for sure eks service from aws and i will use loadblancer service to expose miroservice to the internet 
# i will install prometheus to get metrics for the cluster and make alerting rules  also i will do cloudwatch alarms for billing
